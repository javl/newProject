# newProject

####To do:
1. Come up with a project

####Ideas:
1. We show the sea with only pictures from social media using geolocation. Each photo is placed side by side and the sea is lineup with all the photos. It can be an installation or a website showing the coastline of Belgium and the Nederlands.

  * Other geographical lines might be interesting as well, such as borders. How far from a border do people tag/mention the country on the other side?
  * What are good places to get geolocated images from these days?

2. Data that's moves from server to server in different countries following bird routes. We can use Amazon S3 buckets to transport the data to different countries.  
  * [Amazon server locations](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)
  * [Cloud Flare server locations](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/)



####Interesting links:
* [Border Bumping](http://borderbumping.net/) moves country borders on a map based on what celltower you are connected to in the border area.
* [Border Check](http://roelof.info/projects/(2013)Border_Check/) is a browser plugin that maps internet infrastructure, showing how your data gets routed through the world.
* Just for fun: border-wise [Baarle-Nassau / Baarle-Hertog](https://www.google.nl/maps/@51.4362036,4.9338757,14z) is an interesting area, with parts of the Netherlands within parts of Belgium, within the Netherlands.
